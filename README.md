# Expo Linking API Silent Failure on Authentication URLs

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo `Linking` API where opening URLs requiring authentication fails silently.  No error message is provided, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

When using `Linking.openURL` to open a URL that requires authentication (e.g., a URL that redirects to a login page), the call appears to succeed, but the URL never opens if the user isn't already logged in.  This is because the authentication process happens in the system browser, which the `Linking` API doesn't monitor for completion or errors.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo start`.
3. Try to open the authentication URL (see `bug.js`).  The app will appear to respond normally, but the URL won't open in the browser. 

## Solution

The solution involves using a custom `Linking` event listener to check for URL changes and handle authentication callbacks. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for a potential fix. This requires more advanced handling of URL redirects and checking for specific authentication responses.  It is recommended to use a library such as `react-native-auth0` or a similar authentication solution in a production application for better control and security.
